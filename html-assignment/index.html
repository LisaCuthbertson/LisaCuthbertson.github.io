        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p> My name is Lisa, I am 23 years old and was born and raised in Ottawa. I have had a love for animals since a <em> very young age.</em> To this day I have 3 cats ; Willow, Trixie and Oakley. As well as 1 dog ; Bailey. They mean the world to me. I am happily engaged to the women I want to spend the rest of my life with. </p>
        <p> In my free time, you can find me at a variety of LGBTQ+ events in the city as I have close friends that preform. If I am not out and about I am at home watching <abbr title="Rupaul's Drag race"> RPDR</abbr> or Canada's drag race with my close friends. A local Ottawa preformer placed <sup> 1st </sup> overall in season 2. The talent on the show inspires me to follow my dreams.  </p>
